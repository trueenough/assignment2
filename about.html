    <p class="black">In 2015, University of Minnesota graduate students Curt Lund and Ron Ott co-curated an exhibition on the life and work of art director, designer, and educator Alexey Brodovitch. Created for the Goldstein Museum of Design, the exhibition spanned over five decades.</p>
    <p class="black">In researching Brodovitch’s work for this exhibition, the curators found most accounts focused on his time at the helm of Harper’s Bazaar (1934-58), with very little critical attention paid to his other work, either prior to or after Bazaar. Finding artifacts from these lesser-acknowledged periods became a particular passion for Lund, and dozens of books, magazines and print pieces were collected, at first for display in the exhibition, but later purely out of personal interest. That collecting continues today, and Brodovitch’s life and career prior to Bazaar have become the focus of Lund’s Ph.D. research. As part of that research, he wanted to make these rare and lesser-known objects accessible to the public.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to the staff of the Goldstein Museum of Design, Magrath Library, and the Department of Design, Housing and Apparel; the institutions and individuals who loaned materials to the exhibition; and all the curators, archivists, librarians, design historians and other collaborators who helped to bring the exhibition to life.</p>

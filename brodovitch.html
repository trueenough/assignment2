    <p class="black">Born at the cusp of the 20th century to an aristocratic Russian family — his father was a doctor, his grandfather a successful entrepreneur in what is now St. Petersburg — the young Brodovitch was educated in exclusive schools, and went on to serve as an officer in World War I.</p> 
<p>Loyal to the czar, the family was forced to escape Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution, and in 1920 fled to Paris. There, Brodovitch found himself at the epicenter of another type of revolution — an explosion of vastly diverse artistic movements from across Europe had converged in Paris.</p> 
<p>Europe in the early 20th century had already seen a radical shift in artistic perspective with Cubism, photomontage, experimental typography, the rise of filmmaking and cinema, and the blending of commercial art — advertising, street posters and the like — with fine art. The 1920s exploded with further aesthetic revolution: daring visual experimentation, dynamic visual compositions, and an emphasis on innovation — always to look forward, never to draw inspiration from what had already been done.</p>
<p>Brodovitch thrived in the artistic milieu of Paris. His career gained momentum in 1924 after winning a poster design competition — besting Picasso, who took second place — and he quickly rose to notoriety as a pioneer of “commercial art,” helping elevate the emerging fields of art direction and graphic design.</p> 
<p>In the 1920s, the concept of graphic design as a profession was in its infancy; most designers of the time worked internally at advertising agencies, printing firms or publishing houses. Educational programs for such careers were not yet widespread.</p> 
<p>In 1930, Brodovitch received an invitation from an acquaintance, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, to join the school’s faculty and help launch an advertising design program. Brodovitch accepted the position and he, wife Nina and son Nikita left Paris to begin a new chapter in their lives in the United States.</p>
<p>Brodovitch soon found that his skills as a designer were in great demand, and within a year of moving to the United States, his freelance illustrations and advertising designs were being honored by American peers and trade organizations. One such organization, the Art Director’s Club (ADC) of New York, recognized Brodovitch for superlative designs in their 1931, ’32 and ’33 competitions; the organization then commissioned him to design their 1934 exhibition of honored work.</p>
<p>A mutual friend insisted that Carmel Snow — former fashion editor of <i>Vogue</i> who had recently become editor-in-chief at competitor <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> — meet Brodovitch during the installation of the 1934 Art Director’s Club exhibition. Snow was so impressed by his work she famously hired him on the spot to help her revamp <i>Bazaar</i>.</p>
<p>Snow saw in Brodovitch exactly what was needed to bring <i>Bazaar</i> into the future and into fierce competition with <i>Vogue</i>: an insatiable hunger for the new, the modern, the innovative; an embrace of new and untested ways of thinking and communicating. The same values and passions that drove Brodovitch’s work also drove the fashion world, centered in Paris, that crucible of constant innovation and rebirth.</p> 
<p>Brodovitch’s passion for constantly reinventing and innovating visual communications drove him to pursue side projects while at <i>Bazaar</i>, opportunities outside the strictures of a market-driven fashion publication. One of the most remarkable of these projects was the short-lived but highly influential <i>Portfolio</i> (1950-51), modeled after the Swiss design journal <i>Graphis</i> and other high-profile European design journals of that era. Only a few thousand copies of each issue were printed, and ultimately <i>Portfolio</i> would prove not to be commercially viable — due in large part to Brodovitch’s and Zachary’s insistence that its visual impact not be diluted by advertisements. But it did afford Brodovitch a freedom to pursue ideas outside the boundaries of <i>Bazaar</i>, and an unhindered opportunity to push the envelope of visual and editorial experimentation even further.</p>
<p>Brodovitch’s leading role in the Modernist evolution of American publishing is without question. However, he rarely worked alone. His most remarkable talent was in pushing others — photographers, illustrators, designers — to explore new realms of visual expression. In 1931, after only a year teaching at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art (today the University of the Arts), the school’s principal, Edmondson Hussey, publicly lauded Brodovitch for incorporating “new and interesting techniques which today are much the vogue in the advertising world” into the school’s curricula, and for inciting students to create work “contemporary in idea and European in concept.” </p>
<p>In 1936 PMSIA offered Brodovitch’s first Design Laboratory — a new course format offering “experiments, discussions and analysis, to develop and crystallize new ideas, conception, and technique, guided by the study of psychology, fashion, and needs of the market.” After accepting his position at <i>Bazaar</i>, the Design Laboratory was moved to the New School for Social Research in New York.</p>
<p>In describing his teaching philosophy, Brodovitch famously referred to himself as a “can opener” — releasing and encouraging the innate creativity of his students. Some might consider this a nurturing philosophy, but in truth one would be hard-pressed to refer to Brodovitch as “nurturing.” He could be brutal in his criticism, infamously hard to please and begrudging in praise. So rare was this praise that William Campbell, a 1936 PMSIA student, made note on the back of one of his photographic assignments: “Brodey liked this.”</p>
<p>Despite his somewhat controversial approach to teaching, Brodovitch provoked many students to achieve great heights. A complete list of all the fledgling photographers, art directors and designers whom Brodovitch taught and influenced would be too numerous to include; a small sample must suffice. Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (PMSIA) alumni include photographers Irving Penn, Ben Rose and Arnold Newman, and designer Henry Wolf — who would go on to succeed Brodovitch as art director of <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> in 1958. Visiting critic engagements at Yale in the 1950s expanded Brodovitch's influence to a new population of photography and design students, including Marvin Israel and Rob Roy Kelly. In New York, so many participants in his Design Laboratory sessions became assistants and contributors at <i>Bazaar</i>, they became known as “the Brodovitch Circle.” Many would, of course, go on to establish renowned careers of their own: Richard Avedon, Lillian Bassman, Lisette Model, Eve Arnold, Garry Winogrand, Paul Himmel, Art Kane, Francesco Scavullo, Hans Namuth, Robert Frank, Harvey Lloyd, Leonard Freed, Hiro (Yashuhiro Wakabayashi), and countless others.</p>
